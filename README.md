# Runescape
Old and new scripts, written in my spare time to automate gameplay in Runescape.


<h3> The Old </h3>
Runescape scripting was my introduction to coding.  I wrote dozens of scripts in my spare time when I was younger, and I'm attempting to compile them now as a resource. As I no longer have access to the files on a local computer, I've been spending time searching the internet to find old links to my code so that I may post them here and have them for looking back on in the future.

So far I have found a few old scripts of mine.  Two of the scripts actually have been viewed on pastebin over 1,500 times:

My plan is to hopefully find access to all of my old scripts (it seems they have mostly been archived and deleted on the sites they were originally posted on), and I'm hoping to start scripting again soon in my free time. 

<h3> The New </h3>
I have started writing new scripts in my spare time, partly due to nostalgia of my original coding "adventures," but also because I am interested to apply my years of coding experience to this medium, and see what I can create.

These scripts can be accessed and ran using the tools found at www.powerbot.org.  Hopefully soon my scripts will be in-depth enough to be featured on the site's SDN, located at http://www.powerbot.org/scripts/
